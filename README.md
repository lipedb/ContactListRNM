# RNM Project

This is the **RNM** project, developed using TypeScript and Expo/React Native. Below you'll find an overview of the project structure, its architecture, and some suggestions for improvements in the future.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
RNM/
├── App.tsx                   # Main entry point of the app
├── .expo/                    # Expo configuration
├── app.json                  # Application configuration (used by Expo)
├── babel.config.js           # Babel configuration for transpiling code
├── package.json              # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
├── assets/                   # Images and other static assets
└── src/                      # Main source code directory
    ├── components/           # Reusable components
    ├── screens/              # Application screens
    ├── navigation/           # Navigation configuration
    └── utils/                # Utility functions
```

## Project Architecture

The RNM project follows a typical **React Native/Expo** architecture but using MVU and Clean:

- **App.tsx**: The main entry point, bootstraps the app and provides navigation and global state management if applicable.
- **Components**: Reusable UI components that can be imported into various screens.
- **Screens**: Each screen represents a distinct view in the application, following React Native's component-based architecture.

## Key Dependencies

- **Expo**: Used to manage the app's development workflow, including building and deploying.
- **Expo Navigation**: To handle the app's navigation between screens.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and modern JavaScript features.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the project:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

## Potential Improvements

Here are some features and areas that can be enhanced in the future:

### 1. Dark Mode Support
Implement a **dark mode** toggle using React Native's `Appearance` API or through theming libraries like `styled-components` or `react-native-paper`.

### 2. Multi-Language Support
Add **internationalization (i18n)** support to make the app accessible to users speaking different languages. Libraries like `react-i18next` or `react-native-localize` can be integrated for this purpose.

### 3. Unit Tests
Introduce **unit testing** for the components, screens, and utility functions. Libraries like `Jest` and `React Native Testing Library` can help to automate and streamline the testing process.

### 4. State Management
If the app grows, I'll consider using a **state management** solution like `Redux` or `Recoil` to handle complex states and improve scalability.

### 5. Performance Optimization
Use tools like **Flipper** or **React Native Performance Monitor** to analyze and optimize the app's performance.
